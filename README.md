# ProrokSerialSolution_v1

This project provide a basic serial communication solution to use in Prorok's projects. The actual version of the project contains a script for Arduino and a basic Python software to manage the communication between the Arduino and the device the Python software is running on.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes just clone the repository and open it in your IDE. Then just compile the arduino script on your Arduino.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The project use python 3.7 and the pyserial library.


## Deployment

The project is not designed to be used without editing the code. To use it you must edit both Python and Arduino scripts to make them communicate according to your project requirement. ProrokSerialSolution_v1 only provide several tools to make serial communication easier and safer.
